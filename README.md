# plan

1. settle hosting issues
	- github pages wants jekyll and I don't fancy jekyll-react integration, nor trying to justify jekyll as "modern front-end technolgoy" when I am certain the client's project will not use ruby for any of the server-side tech.
	- perhaps heroku?
2. add webpack
3. add bable and configure es2015 and jsx support
4. get webpack to use babel
5. add jest
6. get jest to use babel
